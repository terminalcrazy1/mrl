# Sway
#### Sway is a tiling window manager written using wlroots. It is extremely lightweight.
These dotfiles contain my ricing for sway.
 - status.sh: status.sh contains the code that runs to print nerdfont icons and data to my taskbar.
 - config: config does everything else. It defines modes, keybinds, font, and my status_command
